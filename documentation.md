## 🛠️ Tool Arsenal & Features

### 🤖 Automation
**Automation Pipeline**
*   **Description**: A full-chain reconnaissance and auditing engine.
*   **Workflow**:
    1.  **Intelligence**: Whois, DNS (Dig), and Subdomain Enumeration (Subfinder, theHarvester, Chaos, Sublist3r).
    2.  **Processing**: Deduplication and Live Host Probing (HTTPX).
    3.  **Deep Scanning**: Port Scanning (Nmap) and Vulnerability Scanning (Nuclei).
    4.  **Reporting**: Generates a consolidated HTML report in the `Reports/` directory.

#### Sample Reports
You can view examples of the reports generated by VAJRA below:
* 📄 **[Summary Report (PDF)](Sample_Report/Vajra_Summary_Sample_Report.pdf)** - High-level overview of findings.
* 📑 **[Full Report (PDF)](Sample_Report/Vajra_Full_Sample_Report.pdf)** - Detailed technical breakdown.

---

### 📡 Info Gathering
*   **Whois**: Retrieves domain registration details (registrar, dates, contacts) from IANA/Registrar databases.
*   **Dig**: Performs comprehensive DNS record enumeration (A, MX, NS, SOA, TXT).
*   **DNSRecon**: Advanced DNS enumeration including zone transfers and wildcard checking.
*   **WAFW00F**: Detects Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and fingerprints their type (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS, Incapsula).
*   **SearchSploit**: Searches the offline Exploit-DB archive for known path-based exploits.

### 🌐 Subdomain Enumeration
*   **Subfinder**: High-speed passive subdomain discovery using online sources and APIs.
*   **Amass**: Deep asset discovery using open source intelligence and active reconnaissance.
*   **theHarvester**: Gathers emails, subdomains, hosts, and URLs from multiple public data sources.
*   **Chaos**: Queries ProjectDiscovery's massive internet-wide asset dataset for rapid discovery.
*   **Sublist3r**: Python-based tool enumerating subdomains via multiple search engines.

### 🟢 Live Subdomains
*   **HTTPX**: A fast and multi-purpose HTTP toolkit to probe a list of subdomains and identify which ones are alive.

### 🔍 Port Scanning
*   **Nmap**: The industry standard. VAJRA provides a full GUI wrapper supporting SYN/Connect scans, NSE scripts, and timing templates.

*   **Port Scanner (Custom Engine)**:
    *   **Why it's Fast**: Unlike Nmap which constructs raw packets, this tool uses a lightweight multi-threaded Python socket engine (up to 200 concurrent threads) for rapid TCP Connect scanning.
    *   **Key Features**:
        *   **Stealth Mode**: Implements randomized delays and shuffles port order to evade simple IPS triggers.
        *   **OS Detection**: Estimates operating system (Windows/Linux) based on Ping TTL values.
        *   **WAF Fingerprinting**: Proactively sends payloads to trigger and identify WAF headers (e.g., `cf-ray`, `Imperva`).
        *   **Banner Grabbing**: Automatically connects to open ports to retrieve service banners (SSH versions, HTTP headers).

### 📸 Web Screenshots
*   **EyeWitness**: Takes automated screenshots of websites to verify large lists of live hosts visually.

### 🕸️ Web Scanning
*   **FFuF**: Fast web fuzzer for directory brute-forcing and parameter discovery.
*   **Gobuster**: Directory/File and DNS brute-forcing tool known for its speed.

### 💉 Web Injection
*   **SQLi Hunter**: A native Python SQL Injection engine using error-based and boolean-blind testing logic (Independent of SQLMap).
*   **Web Fuzzer**: A dedicated module for payload-based testing of input fields.
*   **API Tester**: Utilities for testing REST/GraphQL endpoints.
*   **Crawler**: A spidering tool to map out web application structure.

### 🔓 Vulnerability Scanner
*   **Nuclei**: Template-based vulnerability scanner for finding CVEs and misconfigurations.
*   **Nikto**: Comprehensive web server scanner for dangerous files and outdated software.

### 🔐 Cracker
*   **Hashcat**: Advanced password recovery with rule management and attack modes.
*   **John the Ripper**: CPU-based password auditor.
*   **Hydra**: Parallelized network login cracker (SSH, FTP, etc.).

*   **Hash Finder**:
    *   **Logic**: Uses a heuristic analysis engine to identify hash types based on length, character sets, and specific signatures (e.g., `$1$` for MD5-Unix).
    *   **Capability**: Supports identification of over **200+ hash algorithms**, including modern formats like JWT, Argon2, and BitLocker.
    *   **Probability**: Returns "Most Probable" matches vs "Possibilities" to guide your cracking strategy.

*   **Dencoder**: Universal Text Encoder/Decoder (Base64, Hex, URL, Rot13, JWT, etc.).

### 🚀 Payload Generation
*   **MSFVenom**:
    *   **GUI Wrapper**: A clean interface for the complex Metasploit payload generator.
    *   **Features**:
        *   **Auto-Config**: Automatically detects your local IP (`LHOST`) for reverse connections.
        *   **Encoder Support**: Easily apply encoders like `shikata_ga_nai` with custom iteration counts to bypass AV.
        *   **Template Injection**: Supports the `-x` flag to inject payloads into legitimate executables (with `-k` to keep functionality).
        *   **Multi-Platform**: Generates payloads for Windows, Linux, Android, macOS, PHP, JSP, and more.

*   **ShellForge**:
    *   **The "Swiss Army Knife" of Shells**: A massive offline database of **100+ reverse and bind shell** one-liners.
    *   **Smart Generation**: Instantly generates ready-to-use commands populated with your IP and Port.
    *   **Payload Types**: Bash, Python, Perl, Ruby, Netcat, Socat, PowerShell, HoaxShell, and more.
    *   **Listener Buddy**: Automatically provides the matching listener command (e.g., `nc -lvnp 9001` or `msfconsole -x ...`) for every selected payload.
    *   **Encoding**: Built-in support to URL-encode or Base64-encode payloads for web injection.

### 📄 File Analysis
*   **Strings**: Extract printable character sequences from binary files.

## ⚙️ Settings & Configuration

The **Settings Panel** allows you to customize VAJRA's behavior and appearance.

### 1. General Settings
* **Notifications**: Toggle system toast notifications for scan completion.
* **Theme**: Choose from multiple pre-installed themes to match your aesthetic:
    * **Cyberpunk** (Default)
    * **Dracula**
    * **Kali Dark**
    * **Nord**
    * And more...
* **Config Location**: Settings are saved persistently in your user configuration directory (e.g., `~/.config/VAJRA/Platform.conf` on Linux) using `QSettings`.

### 2. Paths
* **Session Output**: Define where temporary results are stored for the current session. Defaults to `/tmp/Vajra-results`.

### 3. Privileges
* Displays whether you are running as **User** or **Root**.
* **Note**: Root capabilities are required for specific actions like Nmap SYN scans using raw sockets.

### 4. Tool Installer
* **Status Dashboard**: Visual indicator of installed vs. missing tools.
* **One-Click Install**: Automatically installs missing dependencies using your system's package manager (`apt`, `pacman`) or `go install`.

| Command Palette | `Ctrl + K` |
| Toggle Terminal | `Ctrl + \`` |
| Run Active Tool | `Ctrl + R` |
| Stop Active Tool | `Ctrl + Q` |

### Shortcut Usage Guide

*   **Command Palette** (`Ctrl + K`)
    *   Opens a Spotlight-style global search bar in the center of the screen.
    *   **Usage**: Quickly navigate between tools (e.g., type "Nmap", "Hydra") or trigger global actions like "Quit" or "Toggle Terminal" without touching the mouse.

*   **Toggle Terminal** (`Ctrl + \``)
    *   Slides the integrated terminal drawer up or down.
    *   **Usage**: specific for rapid manual tasks. Run shell commands, check network configs, or manage files immediately without leaving the VAJRA interface.

*   **Run Active Tool** (`Ctrl + R`)
    *   Triggers the "Start" or "Run" action for the tool currently currently in view.
    *   **Usage**: After configuring your target modifiers (flags, ports, etc.), press this to immediately launch the scan.

*   **Stop Active Tool** (`Ctrl + Q`)
    *   Sends a termination signal to the currently running process in the active tab.
    *   **Usage**: Emergency stop. Use this if a scan hangs, is taking too long, or if you realize you entered the wrong target.

*   **Save Session** (`Ctrl + S`)
    *   Exports the current workspace state to a local JSON file.
    *   **Usage**: Preserves your open tabs, specific tool configurations, and inputs so you can pause work and resume later.

*   **Open Session** (`Ctrl + O`)
    *   Opens a file dialog to load a `.json` session file.
    *   **Usage**: Restores your exact workspace layout and configurations from a previous session.

*   **Close Tab** (`Ctrl + W`)
    *   Removes the currently active tab from the view.
    *   **Usage**: Declutter your workspace by closing tools you are finished with. Note: The main Dashboard tab cannot be closed.
